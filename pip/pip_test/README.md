PiBot is an educational robot designed by JdeRobot team. It is composed by a RaspberryPI board, a PiCam camera, several common (and cheap) sensors and actuators, a battery and a frame of 3D printable pieces.

It is open hardware.

Its drivers are provided as open source, so students may program PiBot applications in Python. In addition, they can program a simulated PiBot in Gazebo too. The robot model and plugin are also provided with the same programming interface as the real PiBot.
